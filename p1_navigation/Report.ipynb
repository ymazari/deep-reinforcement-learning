    "# Project Report: Navigation\n",
    "For more details about how to execute the code, look at “Instructions” and “Files” sections in README.md.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Algorithm\n",
    "In this project, I implemented double deep Q-learning with experience replay.\n",
    "It’s a Deep Q-Learning network, with two neural networks: A main network and a fixed Q-targets network to avoid oscillations and make the learning more stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experience replay part, re-used from the code in a previous assignment, attempts to mitigate issues with correlations between successive inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The double DQN tries to address the issue with overestimation of action-values by using both models for the estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training consist in running several episodes,\n",
    "1. Starting from an initial state\n",
    "2. Make the agent take an action (epsilon-greedy)\n",
    "3. Get the reward and next state for the taken action and perform a weight update based on the expected and target action-values, which are determined using the above-mentioned neural networks.\n",
    "4. “Soft-update” is used to update the target network parameter every pre-defined number of steps.\n",
    "5. The model weights with best average score are saved under “best_model.pth” for subsequent use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Architecture\n",
    "It’s a fully-connected network with 3 hidden layers. The input size is 37 which corresponds to the environment state size. The output size is 4, corresponding to the number of actions.\n",
    "The size of the hidden layers is a hyper-parameter and was chosen to be 64, based on a previous assignment, and was found to yield good empirical results.  \n",
    "See the cell above.\n",
    "## Hyperparameters\n",
    "The following were used:  \n",
    "BUFFER_SIZE = int(1e5), replay buffer size  \n",
    "BATCH_SIZE = 64, minibatch size  \n",
    "TAU = 1e-3, for soft update of target parameters  \n",
    "UPDATE_EVERY = 4, how often to update the network  \n",
    "lr=5e-4, the learning rate  \n",
    "gamma=0.99, discount factor  \n",
    "\n",
    "As well as:\n",
    "Hidden units = 2, the number of hidden units for the neural networks  \n",
    "Hidden size=64, the size of the hidden units  \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I used\n",
    "Adam optimizer as the optimizer  \n",
    "Huber loss (torch.nn.SmoothL1Loss()) as a loss function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the initial values for the hyperparameters was based on a previous assignment, and then verified that these values lead to good empirical results\n",
    "## Plot of Rewards\n",
    "We see that from (roughly) 500 iterations, the agent archives the minimum desired average score 13, and with 2000 iterations eventually achieves a best score of 17.55. The best model weights are saved under “best_model.pth”.\n",
    "See the figure above for the plot.\n",
    "## Ideas for Future Work\n",
    "1. In order to achieve an average score of 13, 500 iterations were sufficient. But when watching the trained agent, I observed that when it reaches a state where the yellow bananas are far away, it gets “stuck” and oscillates until the episode is terminated. So I let it train for the whole 2000 iterations to let the agent explore more states and better learn the state-actions. This resulted in a higher score, and also allowed the agent to perform better when I “watched” a few episodes.\n",
    "2. Another possibility for improvement is to further tune the hyperparameters. I created another notebook in the repo “Project 1 - Hyper-parameter Tuning.ipynb” where I use Bayesian optimization for that purpose. I haven’t included it in this submission, but better hyperparameters will allow the model to learn faster and achieve higher scores in less iterations.\n",
    "3. Another possibility, as suggested in the lecture, is to use Rainbow as it is considered a baseline, but didn’t do it because the results I got are already good enough for the purposes of this project."
